# JDV Game

First Ironhack Game Project

This is a game for two players

### Context

This is a clone of a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ueh549xEV9E) tutorial

The famous tic-tac-toe game, which makes and/or was part of many childhood, is back.
Let's remember the time when we had fun with a pencil and a sheet of paper; or rather multiple sheets!

### The Game
Complete a sequence of three "X" or three "O" horizontally, vertically or diagonally to win this classic game.

We have the game houses that form a hastag (#), inside it we complete with "X" or "O", to fill just click on the house you want. Whoever completes 3 houses in the first row wins.
